## SSH shortcut keys    
    ~.: Disconnect.
    ~^Z: Background ssh.
    ~#: List forwarded connections.
    ~&: Background ssh at logout when waiting for forwarded connection / X11 sessions to terminate.
    ~?: Display a list of escape characters.
    ~B: Send a BREAK to the remote system (only useful for SSH protocol version 2 and if the peer supports it).
    ~C: Open command line. Currently this allows the addition of port forwardings using the -L, -R and -D options (see above). It also allows the cancellation of existing remote port-forwardings using -KR[bind_address:]port. !command allows the user to execute a local command if the PermitLocalCommand option is enabled in ssh_config(5). Basic help is available, using the -h option.
    ~R: Request rekeying of the connection (only useful for SSH protocol version 2 and if the peer supports it).
